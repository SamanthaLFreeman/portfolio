      <p className='about-text'>Yeah? Well I'm the Lord of Time. People assume that time is a strict progression of cause-and-effect... but actually, from a non-linear, non-subjective viewpoint, it's more like a big ball of wibbly-wobbly... timey-wimey... stuff. Aw, I wanted to be ginger! I've never been ginger! And you, Rose Tyler! Fat lot of good you were! You gave up on me! Ooh, that's rude. Is that the sort of man I am now? Am I rude? Rude and not ginger. I'm the Doctor, I can save the world with a kettle and some string! And look! I'm wearing a vegetable!</p>
